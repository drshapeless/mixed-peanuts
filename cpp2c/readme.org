#+title: readme

Using C++ in C is simple.

* Create a static library
#+begin_src shell
  clang++ -c cpp2c.cc
  ar rvs libcpp2c.a cpp2c.o
#+end_src

Copy the static library to the lib directory. However, the c++ code
are very likely to use some c++ runtime function, we need to also link
the -lstdc++ when compiling the C code.

* Using libc++ instead of libstdc++
The libstdc++ is provided by GCC. We now have an option of using
libc++ provided by llvm.

The key to successfully link the static library to your c executable
is consistency. If you are using libstdc++, keep using it.

#+begin_src shell
  clang++ -stdlib=libc++ -c cpp2c.cc
#+end_src

When compiling C code, link with -lc++.
