#+title: readme

This repo aims at collecting the ways to mix languages together.

The base idea is to export or import a C foreign function interface
(FFI). Either by generating some object files, or create a library,
static or shared.

* Compile C as object
This is very simple. Just use the -c flag. The -fPIC flag is for
generating position independent code.
#+begin_src shell
  cc -c -fPIC shapeless.c
#+end_src

* Compile C as library
We have the object. We use ~.so~ in Linux and ~.dylib~ in macOS.
#+begin_src shell
  # static
  ar rvs libshapeless.a shapeless.o

  # shared
  cc -shared -o libshapeless.so shapeless.o
#+end_src
